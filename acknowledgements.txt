ElmsConnector is using:
	* Castle Windsor (http://www.castleproject.org/container/) 
		- for it's internal structure and to allow easy extensibility.
	* Rhino.Mocks (http://ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks.aspx)
		- to make testing easy
	* xUnit (http://www.codeplex.com/xunit)
		- My testframework of choice
	* ILMerge (http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mbarnett/ilmerge.aspx)
		- To merge Castle with ElmsConnector to avoid versioning issues for users.

The build script was inspired by Rhino.Mocks and is using psake by James Covacs

Thank all these great projects for their high quality tools that made creating ElmsConnector possible!
